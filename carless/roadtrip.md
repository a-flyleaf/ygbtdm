Featuring <b>heart-stopping drama!</b>

<b>Survival of the fittest!</b>

{%include figure.html subcat="carless" img="3" alt="“Cranky cuz you don’t drive, aren’t you!” yells Caleb, high above in his uwu monster truck. Below in a jeep, Kay Lin crawls over Joce to shake her fist at the behemoth."%}

<b>Interpersonal conflict!</b>

{%include figure.html subcat="carless" img="6" alt="Joce, dramatically, in the foreground: “I got in the wrong car once…” Kay Lin, from the back: “The light is /green/ let’s /go/!” But Joce doesn’t respond. “Never again…”"%}

{%include figure.html subcat="carless" img="7" alt="The accountant drives the convertible, holding a purple card and gloating: “I /knew/ it, I /knew/ you had a license all along~!” Kay Lin, duct-taped to the back seat: “That’s my… social security number…”"%}

And <b>more lies and deception than that one ex who just can't let you go!</b>

{%include figure.html subcat="carless" img="9" alt="Two-panel comic parodying a manga meme.
