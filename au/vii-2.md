"You good?"

"We're dead. But, ehh." Shrug. "<span class="x">I</span>’m good."

Seems to amuse her.

<i>Might as well shoot the shit.</i>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur slumps down on a log, staring out into the abyss. As prompted, Kay&nbsp;Lin joins them, and talks:</figcaption></figure>

"You're pretty chill for someone who thinks we're gonna die."

"Eh, worryin's pointless."

Not like Kay Lin seems fussed, either.

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span><span class="block">Sequitur, questioning, points at her.</span> <span class="block">It’s too dark to read her expression.</span> <br/>[silhouette, side view?]</figcaption></figure>

"It's been... fun."

"That a joke?"

"Never been in a car crash before."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur’s amused.</figcaption></figure>

Yeah, night's just full of surprises, ain't it? Could'a been vampires.

Kay Lin doesn't respond. Sequitur is reminded that they haven't seen her around much before tonight.

Must be new here!

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Cue Sequitur infodump. They gesture around Kay&nbsp;Lin without really paying attention to her.</figcaption></figure>

Vampires, supposedly, live in the castle the group was (is?) headed towards; that was the goal, to see if it's really abandoned. Not everyone believes the stories, but they're a hell of a deal; there's "vamp-hunters" around and everything.

Far as Sequitur's concerned, mind, it's all rumors. Then again, they would've said the same about the rabbits.

At least the vampires are human. Kind of.

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin is quiet.</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is mildly concerned. [small "?"]</figcaption></figure>

Kay Lin seems distant.

"Better human than monster... right."

Mhm.

Idly Sequitur wonders if anyone's noticed either of them are gone. How long *has* it been, anyway...?

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>They start to get up. [speech bubble?]</figcaption></figure>

<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Kay Lin grabs their arm.</figcaption></figure>

<i>Skin's cold.</i>

"Say, Sequitur..."

<figure><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x300.png" alt=""/>
<figcaption><span class="x">Image: </span>Sequitur is sweating. Kay Lin stares at them closely.</figcaption></figure>

Aw, who're they kidding. They're dead meat out here.

"Could you... do me a favor?"
